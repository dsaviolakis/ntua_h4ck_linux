This is the Minoan Labyrinth, a multi-level **beginner friendly** challenge...
Do you have what it takes to uncover all the flags and conquer the labyrinth? Dive in and see for yourself!

There are 7 levels totally (0-6). The binary initially creates the files necessary for level 0. Each time you find the flag, you should run the binary again and provide the flag. If it is correct, the binary will delete the files of the previous level and will provide the necessary files for the next. The progress is being kept in a local file.

The source code is now available! Feel free to check it out, preferably after solving the challenge.
